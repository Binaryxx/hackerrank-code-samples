repository that has samples of my code for the challenges in hackerrank.com


the python challenges were done before the Coursera course for Python so those may be very inefficient and unoptimized

    I have finished all of the Introduction and Basic Data Types Subdomains; the Problem Solving (Basic) and Python (Basic) Skills may take too long to finish based on the number of challenges; will come back later to first optimize my already submitted solutions and then work on completing all of the challenges in the Problem Solving (Basic) and Python (Basic) Skills once (1) I finish my Coursera course for IBM Data Science, (2) have at least 3 projects in my portfolio for Data Science, and (3) I have prepared for interviews with new anecdotes
        Looking at the number of challenges to complete between Python and SQL, I might expand on the Python challenges to the Strings Subdomain so that the number of challenges completed is relatively balanced
  
  
for the sql challenges, those will be done after the SQL course in Coursera so that I can finish them faster rather than trying to relearn SQL again from scratch
    I will try to finish only those in the Basic Select and Basic Join Subdomains to keep the number of challenges manageable
